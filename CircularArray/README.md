# Double-Ended Queue (Deque)
A data structure called a deque (pronounced like ?deck?) is closely related to a queue. The name deque stands for double-ended queue. The difference between the two is that with a deque you can insert or remove from either end of the queue. Implement a deque using arrays (start with CircularArrayQueue).
